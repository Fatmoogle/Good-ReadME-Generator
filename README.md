# Good Read-Me Generator

  
## Description 

This project will prompt the user to input the needed information in order to gereate a concise and well crafted README file for their own project (actually, this is what I used to make my own as well!). Using the Inquirer module from Node, users can put exactly what they want for each section of the README they want to generate, and then the code will create a README.md file in the directory they may use.
